My research is at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, earth sciences, and high-performance computing. I am interested in efficient unsupervised and supervised learning methods for leveraging ever growing datastores of spatio-temporal earth science observations, forecasts, and projections to understand our environment. Recent projects have included developments of novel deep learning methods for spatio-temporal downscaling, physical model emulation, generating virtual sensors, and cloud tracking.

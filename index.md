description: Remote Sensing, Vegetation Mapping and Data Science

<p align="justify">
My research is focused on monitoring vegetation using a combination of remote sensing data and machine learning methods. I have experience working with earth observing data from different sensors (multispectral/hyperspectral/lidar), mounted on various platforms (spaceborne/airborne) and collected across different spatiotemporal scales to study diverse vegetation types (crops/arctic tundra shrubs/tropical savannas). In collaboration with eminent scientists at reputed government agencies such as NASA, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the US Forest Service, I have developed and deployed spatiotemporal data mining methods for improved scientific understanding and enhanced predictive modeling.

Over the years, I have built a strong background in the diverse areas of remote sensing, data science, machine learning, hydrology and climate science. I have published my research in high-impact journals and presented at a variety of conferences, spanning different focus areas like computer science, geophysics and landscape ecology.

My research broadly focuses on the intersection of machine learning and the earth sciences.  More narrowly, I study how we can use intelligent machines to extract information from satellite imagery and climate models. At the NASA Earth Exchange I am developing probabilistic models to generate higher spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution satellite imagery to better monitor the environment.

description: Remote Sensing, Vegetation Mapping and Data Science

---
My research is focused on monitoring vegetation with the help of remote sensing data and machine learning methods. I have experience working with earth observing data from different sensors (multispectral/hyperspectral), mounted on various platforms (spaceborne/airborne) and collected across different spatial scales (landscape to continental scales) to study diverse vegetation types (crops/arctic tundra shrubs/grasslands). Through collaborations with eminent scientists at reputed government agencies like NASA, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), USDA Forest Service etc., I have developed and deployed spatiotemporal data mining methods for improved scientific understanding and enhanced predictive modeling. 

Over the years, I have built a strong background in the diverse areas of remote sensing, data science, machine learning, hydrology and climate science. I have published my research in high-impact journals and presented at a variety of conferences, spanning different focus areas like Computer Science, Geophysics and Landscape Ecology.

description: Machine Learning, Climate Science, and Remote Sensing 

---

My research is at the intersection of machine learning, earth sciences, image processing, and high-performance computing. I am interested in building machine learning techniques for extracting information from remotely sensed satellite imagery and atmospheric models to better understand the effects of climate change. These include applications such as spatial and temporal downscaling, emulation of physical models, generating virtual sensors, and near-term forecasting. 

# Bio

Thomas is a research scientist at the NASA Ames Research Center and [Bay Area Environmental Research Institute](https://baeri.org/) within the NASA Earth Exchange [(NEX)](https://www.nasa.gov/nex)  in Moffett Field, CA. In August 2018 Thomas earned a Ph.D. in Interdisciplinary Engineering from Northeastern University working in the [Sustainability and Data Sciences Lab](https://web.northeastern.edu/sds/) advised by Auroop Ganguly and Jennifer Dy. His [research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBYKfMTS23Q) has won [runner-up best paper and runner-up best student paper awards at SIGKDD 2017](https://www.kdd.org/awards/view/2017-sigkdd-best-paper-award-winners) and outstanding graduate researcher at Northeastern University in 2018.  He is an elected student member of the committee on [Artificial Intelligence Applications to Environmental Science for the American Meterological Society (AMS)](https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/stac/committees/committee-on-artificial-intelligence-applications-to-environmental-science/membership/). Prior to graduate school he worked at multiple startups in the Boston area, including the MIT Media Lab spin-out Affectiva.  He completed his bachelors in mathematics at the University of Maryland College Park in 2012.
